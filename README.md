  Here you'll find the docker images of
  challenges/vulnerabilities/misconfigurations/flaws I face while pentesting
  different kinds of applications.

# La Introducción

## Pentest Labs

I wasn't really able to come up with a name for the gitbook, so PentestLabs will do ¯\\_\(ツ\)\_/¯

```
$ give me super-powers
```

So, with the super prowess, let's continue. The series will be random, I'll try to work on weekends on any interesting vulnerabilities/flaws I come across. 

## About

^These challenges are highly inspired from [OWASP SKF](https://owasp-skf.gitbook.io/) labs and the purpose is to disclose interesting vulnerabilities/misconfigurations/flaws while not disclosing client's name/environment and all in the format of docker images so one doesn't have to waste time for dependencies issues.  

You can contact me @[syed\_\_umar](https://twitter.com/syed__umar) for hints for the posted challenges \(hold tight, more coming in the near future\).
