  Here you'll find the docker images of
  challenges/vulnerabilities/misconfigurations/flaws I face while pentesting
  different kinds of applications.

# La Introducción

## Pentest Labs

I wasn't really able to come up with a name for the gitbook, so PentestLabs will do ¯\\_\(ツ\)\_/¯

```
$ give me super-powers
```

So, with the super prowess, let's continue. The series will be random, I'll try to work on weekends on any interesting vulnerabilities/flaws I come across. 

## Why Tho?

Well, I was hoping of giving back atleast something of what I learnt from the community in the past years while not having them complain about dependencies or deployment issues, to give each challenge in a dockerized environment.

These challenges are highly inspired from [OWASP SKF](https://owasp-skf.gitbook.io/) labs \(they mainly focus on generic vulnerabilities for people to get started in WAPT\). The purpose of these labs will be to to disclose interesting vulnerabilities/misconfigurations/flaws/chainings while not disclosing client's name/environment and all in the format of docker images. I'll be working on these in weekends and in my spare-time as a side project.

You can contact me @[syed\_\_umar](https://twitter.com/syed__umar) for hints for the posted challenges \(which don't have any writeup currently\) or if you came across an interesting vulnerability and would like me to create a challenge or to submit one. \(▀̿Ĺ̯▀̿ ̿\)
