  Taking over the Admin Panel of a Laravel Application because of a small
  misconfiguration in the production application.

# Admin Panel Takeover - I

## Usage/Installation:

You can download and run the docker image utilizing the following one liner: 

```bash
$ docker run -it --rm uexpl0it/admin-panel-takeover:latest \
    /bin/bash -c 'chmod +x run.sh && ./run.sh'
```

## Description

The application is utilizing Laravel \(~5\) to create/edit/remove posts in a blog type environment. The admin/dev currently doesn't have knowledge to hide something utilizing PHP code and that information could be utilized by an attacker to takeover the Admin Panel and deface/defame/edit the application. 

The challenge isn't to be solved with brute-forcing credentials, you may have to find some hidden directories. The difficulty depends upon ones knowledge, solving it could take _20 minutes_ to _3-4 hours_. 

The Laravel Application's base was cloned from Traversy Media's Github page. 

## Goal:

The end goal of the application is to grab the flag in the dashboard after successfully accessing the admin panel. Will try to post the detailed solution with fixes next weekend.
