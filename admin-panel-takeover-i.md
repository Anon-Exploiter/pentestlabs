## Description

The application is utilizing Laravel \(~5\) to create/edit/remove posts in a blog type environment. The admin/dev currently doesn't have knowledge to hide something utilizing PHP code and that information could be utilized by an attacker to takeover the Admin Panel and deface/defame/edit the application. 

Also, the challenge isn't to be solved with brute-forcing credentials The difficulty depends upon ones knowledge/skills, solving it could take _20 minutes_ to _2-3_ hours. 

## Goal:

The end goal of the application is to grab the flag in the dashboard after successfully accessing the admin panel. Will try to post the detailed solution with fixes next weekend. 

## Credits:

Thanks to my colleagues from Ebryx for helping in the beta-testing. Also, the Laravel application's base was cloned from Traversy Media's [Github](https://github.com/bradtraversy/lsapp) page.
